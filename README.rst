What is this?
=============

The purpose of this tool is to create a personalized Bible reading plan based on
D.A. Carson's reading plan from his book `For the Love of God
<https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/loveofgod/>`__. Instead of having to start
on January 1st, with this tool you can specify your desired start date and the
tool will create the reading plan with the first reading on that date.

TODO
====

Implement this in Dart with Angular so that this can be hosted and used by
others more easily.
